4.0 : **2013**

-----

+ never got around to rebuilding it

Instead picked up node.js/express/handlebars/ember



5.0 : **2014**

____

+ jquery / vanilla hybrid
+ require.js
+ handlebars
+ sass

Everything is split into smaller components/modules that don't rely on each other to work.

+ That way they can be interchanged down the road.
+ The WYSIWYG itself (iframe) is separate from the controls.
+ There are 3 separate control choices (buttons)
    * basic
    * advanced
    * full


Sass was introduced so that themes could be added easily,
as well as using loops to create the CSS dynamically for the colors
